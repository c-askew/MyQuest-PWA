      <div class="collapsible-header header-on-white"><i class="material-icons">book</i>Reading Lists Online</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Reading List Online (RLO) will allow you to easily manage your module reading, and ensures that academic resources are available and accessible to you.
        The RLO for a module can also be accessed by logging on to the relevant E-learning@Tees  site.  If you are unable to find a RLO for a particular module, please contact your module leader about this.
        Your module reading list contains details of items like books, journals, web pages or databases.
        These items have been selected for you by your module leaders, so when you are doing coursework the reading list is the best place to start.
        However, you can (and should) also read more widely - see the sections on 'Finding Books' and 'Finding Journal Articles' for more help.
